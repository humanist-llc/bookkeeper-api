# How to setup project

Make sure you are logged into modal cli and run: `modal config show`
Create an `.env` file in the root project directory:
```
TOKEN_ID=ak-*****
TOKEN_SECRET=as-*****
```
Open the project in VSCode using Dev Containers.

To test your code, open a new terminal in VSCode and type `modal serve app.py`
